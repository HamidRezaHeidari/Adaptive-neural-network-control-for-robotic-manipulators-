This project is about control a 4-DOF SCARA manipulator with an adaptive neural network method. this implementation is based on a Q1-Rank paper "Adaptive neural network control for robotic manipulators with guaranteed finite-time convergence" . The dynamic of manipulator for 2-DOF projects are derive from Lagrange dynamic equation and for 4-DOF I use MultiBody simulink model.
